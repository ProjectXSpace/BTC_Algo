# BTC Algo

This project contains various algorithms and models for analyzing and predicting Bitcoin prices(returns) in both classification and reression forms.

1. ML - such as Random Forest, XGboost etc.. fine-tuned with Randomized Search and cross-validation. Across large parameter space.
2. Neural Nets - a mix of CNN with RNN(LSTM)

## Project Structure

- `basic_ml/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for basic machine learning algorithms and statistical tests.
- `Data/`: Contains the data used for the project in CSV format.
- `Obsolete/`: Contains older versions of the algorithms and tests.
- `preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for preprocessing the data.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
